# laser_tracking_system
The mechanism in the lower part of our setup allows the laser to turn left and right, while the upper part of the laser rotates up and down. The motor driver card in our system takes the order from raspberry pi and transfers it to the stepper motors thanks to the codes we write. The mechanism connected to therod at the top of the device performs the rotary movement by connecting it to the stepper motor with a pulley. It also provides the rotation of the laser so that our system gets a 360 degree view in space. This system is used frequently in the defense industry and medical technology.
Image Processing with TenserFlow
TensorFlow is a free and open source software library used for data flow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks. The figure shows the object definition process with the Tenserflow library we used in our project.
